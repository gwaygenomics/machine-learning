# A directory for exploratory machine learning analyses

This directory is home to exploratory analyses that help answer questions about how we should do machine learning. For algorithm implementations see the [`algorithms`](../algorithms) directory. For other types of analyses, place them here.

Notebooks should be exported to scripts for review. For example, from the directory containing your scripts run:

```sh
jupyter nbconvert --to=script *.ipynb
```
